Notes on what files montecarlo.py uses.
This is to aid testing.

Command line from runSims.js usually has `-s` (save outputs), `-i` and `--seed` but no file names or directories.

`MC/inputs/input_data.json` read to find what to vary.  Use lists in 2 sections, 'dat_files' and 'inp_files'.  For 'dat_files' the zero run (`-z`) does nothing except write the data out.  For 'inp_files' the zero run writes out labels.  Both execute `vary()` on the file object and then `print_mc()`.

`VFile(fname)`
    `pref,ext = fname.split('.')`
    input: pref+'_mc0.'+ext
    output: pref+'_mc.'+ext

It reads from an `_mc0.EXT` file and writes to `_mc.EXT`.

`DatFile` includes an `SDFile` but `InpFile` includes `Effects`.
    `DatFile(file_data, random_generator)` where `file_data` is a `JSON` structure
    that include 'filename' -> `modfile/FILENAME.dat` as primary input (for `VFILE`).

`InpFile(fname)` calls `VCFile(fname+'.inp')` and then creates
    `Effects` which has no arguments.

`Effects` reads from `MC/inputs/inp_distribution.txt`.
    Writes to `MC\input_variation\inp.txt`.
    Uses `Component` in a transitory way to wrap some lines.
    This javascript code in `runSims.js` actually fills in the iteration number which is the first field on the data lines:

   ```javascript
        let str = String(i + ' '.repeat(16));
        let INP_OUTPUT_FILE = './MC/input_variation/inp.txt';
        if (fs.existsSync(INP_OUTPUT_FILE)) {
            fs.appendFileSync(INP_OUTPUT_FILE, str.substring(0,16) + '  ')
   ```

`Component` actually generates the random number and interprets 
    parameters.  It would probably be better to generate them once and retain them.
    Although `Component` instances are temporary, there is persistent state held in a class variables.  This is the state of the random number generator for each group.

Note that montecarlo.py is only used to generate a single simulation.  Because of the state-keeping in `Component` it would actually generate the same numbers if called again.

An effect may be made of several components that are summed or added to the mean.

2022-09-13 Start `issue12` branch to fix random number generation with LogNormal .inp files.
Initial focus on being able to run tests.  Create `py_tests` folder at very top level to use the pytest framework, and configure `VSCode` for same. Created `test_monte.py` and, after painful experiments with getting it to load the code, made a simple test work.

Further testing of `Effects` revealed 2 different ways the code was inconsistent with the current `numpy.random` interface:
  1. The state has moved to the `BitGenerator` and is not directly accessible.
  2. `randn` is obsolescent (it is still available, but not through the old interface).
Fixed both.

----------
Modified test code to write out iteration number.

To Do
=====

  - [x] Analyze input and output files for `montecarlo.py`.  See above.
  - [x] Pick a testing framework: `pytest` (only alternative in `VSCode` is the older `unittest`)
  - [x] Incorporate montecarlo module into it.  Remarkably undocumented how to do so.  Done by supplementing `sys.path` and using `import`.  Needed one import to get the names at top level, and another to get the module accessible for messing with its global state.  The working directory, at least when I run the test code in the debugger, is the top level project directory.
  - [x] Modify key classes and functions to allow me to override the default file name conventions.  Done for those involved with `InpFile`.  See below for `DatFile`.
  - [x] Eliminate some hard coding of path separators
  - [x] Write first tests, including setup of test framework in `VSCode`.
  - [x] Fix breakage from interface changes in `numpy` for the code in `Component`.
  - [x] Identify why there is no simulation number on outputs from first tests of `Effects`.
  - [x] Test writes out iteration number to `Effects` output file
  - [ ] Find out if the way I'm saving and restoring state is effective.  In particular, should I be doing a deep or shallow copy?  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/22337 created 2022-09-25.  Answer: it's already a copy.  Current code OK.  But maybe add a test for it.
  - [ ] Make argument and instance variable naming more consistent across the module (maybe)
  - [ ] Make handling of file closing more consistent and correct.  Sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't.  Inconsistent and confusing.  This has 2 dimensions: handling of filelike vs pathlike arguments, and handling across different classes and methods.
  - [ ] Move all test input files into project source tree under `py_tests`.
  - [ ] Complete tests for `Effects` as is.  In particular
    + [  ] test values are reasonable given mean and sd
    + [  ] values are in expected domain (maybe)
    + [  ] correlation pattern as expected
    + [  ] fails when given invalid specs
    + [  ] works for all distributions
  - [ ] Add tests for Effects with multiple iterations.
        Requires properly reseting global state of `RG` and `Component.group_state`
  - [ ] Test `InpFile`
  - [ ] Recreate failure of LogNormal for `.inp` (could actually be done on `Effects`)
  - [ ] Correct failure of LogNormal in main code
  - [ ] Update package version and changelog
  - [ ] Reintegrate with main `repeatable` branch
  - [ ] Publish changes
  - [ ] Extend flexible specification of inputs and outputs to `DatFile`, `SDFile` and other related classes and functions.  This might be good to do before publication, in case I broke something.
  - [ ] Centralize random number logic in one place.  Currently both `InpFile` and `DatFile` have independent code.  Unclear how feasible this is since they have different types of correlations they are trying to achieve. (maybe)
  - [ ] In particular, `InpFile` should use the new, percentile-based logic to achieve correlation, instead of unreliable use of internal random generator state.
  - [ ] Allow specification of log-normal parameters the old way (on the log scale) (maybe)
  - [ ] Allow specification of truncated distributions; current code does censoring, bringing extreme values in to the boundary. (maybe)
  - [ ] Incorporate my fuller understanding of correlations in `.inp` files into user documentation.  Currently quite a bit is in this file and in comments in `montecarlo.py` (low)
  - [ ] Incorporate relevant material from https://github.com/ecfairle/CHDMOD into this project (may already be in our `README.md`) and eliminate reference to it in documentation and code (e.g., `montecarlo.py` has a comment referring to it.) (low)
